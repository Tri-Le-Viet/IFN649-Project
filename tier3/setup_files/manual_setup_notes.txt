If using scp to copy from windows need to do the following:
sudo yum install dos2unix
dos2unix AWS_setup.sh

Otherwise can just scp from raspberry pi

Once in mySQL run source db_setup.sql to setup database (pretty self-explanatory)

run the following to symlink my-server to sites-enabled:
  sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/my-server /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

then:
  sudo nginx -s reload

then start gunicorn:
gunicorn -w 4 -b 127.0.0.1:5000 app:gunicorn_app
